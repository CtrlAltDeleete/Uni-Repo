Description: Write a C++ program, which declares integer ‘a’, float ‘b’ and character ‘c’. Ask user for an integer value and store it in ‘a’, for a float value and store it in ‘b’ and for a character value and store it in ‘c’. At the end, print the values of these three variables on screen. Your output should be as below. Indent your code and include comments for improving the readability of your code

Code:
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a;                              // Declaring Variables
    float b;
    char c;
    cout<<"Enter Integer Value: ";      // Taking Inputs
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"Enter Float Value: ";
    cin>>b;
    cout<<"Enter Character Value: ";
    cin>>c;
    cout<<""<<endl;                     // empty line
    cout<<"***You have entered***"<<endl;   // Printing Entered Values on Screen
    cout<<"Integer Value: "<<a<<endl;
    cout<<"Float Value: "<<b<<endl;
    cout<<"Character Value: "<<c<<endl;

    return 0;
}
